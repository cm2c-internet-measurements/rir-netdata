   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Netdata v3's documentation!
======================================

Pipeline for producing a consolidated sqlite3 file containing:

- an imported version of all five RIRs "delegated-extended" files
- an imported version of a current snapshot of an RPKI relying party tool (AKA "validator") 
- an imported version of a current RIPE "riswhois" dump

In addition, all three datasets can be enriched with the following:

- country codes for all prefixes and autonomous system numbers
- all prefixes are "exploded" from their notations into a (ibegin, iend) numberic pair 
  for making easy comparisons and inclusion tests

  - for IPv4 prefixes the base IPv4 address is directly converted to a 32 bit integer
  - for IPv6 prefixes the same is performed but using just the lower 64 bits of the prefix 

Table Schemas
-------------

- Table produced from **"delegated-extended"** files:

::

   CREATE TABLE numres (
      id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, 
      rir text, 
      cc text, 
      type text, 
      block text, 
      length integer, 
      date integer, 
      status text, 
      orgid integer, 
      istart INTEGER, 
      iend INTEGER, 
      prefix VARCHAR(80), 
      equiv INTEGER
   );

Some of these fields (istart, iend, prefix and equiv) are generated by the *enrichers* and
created empty during import.
